      A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb),
      while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15–24 lb). All healthy puppies
      grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy
      grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
      Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other
      animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.

      Puppies are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours
      interacting with either their mother or littermates. When puppies are
      socialized with humans, particularly between the ages of eight and twelve
      weeks, they develop social skills around people. Those that do not receive
      adequate socialization during this period may display fearful behavior
      around humans or other dogs as adults. The optimum period for
      socialisation is between eight and twelve weeks; professional animal
      trainers and the American Kennel Club advise puppies should be introduced
      to "100 People by 12 Weeks" and have encountered a wide and varied
      selection of people and environments.
