        A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary
        altriciality and are totally dependent on their mothers for survival.
        They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days. After about
        two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to explore the world
        outside their nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to
        eat solid food and grow baby teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social
        animals and usually enjoy human companionship.

      <p>
        A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb),
        while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15–24 lb). All puppies
        display primary altriciality and healthy puppies grow quickly after
        birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is
        commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers
        specifically to young dogs,[1] while pup may be used for other animals
        such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.

        A dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphin
        species belong to the families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins),
        Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World river
        dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct
        Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species
        named as dolphins.
