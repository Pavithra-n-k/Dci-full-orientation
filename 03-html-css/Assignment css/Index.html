      <p class="c1 it1">
        The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
        descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from
        the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest
        living relative.
      </p>
      <p class="c2 it1">
        Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over
        15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.

      <p class="c3 it1">
        The Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event occurred 65 million years ago
        and brought an end to the non-avian dinosaurs and the appearance of the
        first carnivorans.[20] The name carnivoran is given to a member of the
        order Carnivora.
      </p>
      <p class="c4 it1">
        The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like caniforms and the cat-like
        feliforms began their separate evolutionary paths just after the end of
        the dinosaurs. The first members of the dog family Canidae appeared 40
        million years ago, of which only its subfamily the Caninae survives
        today in the form of the wolf-like and fox-like canines. Within the
        Caninae, the first members of genus Canis appeared six million years
        ago,[15] the ancestors of modern domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, and
        golden jackals.

      <h2 class="Bold">Domestication</h2>
      <p class="c5 it1">
        The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated
        dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic,
        genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local
        wolf.
      </p>
      <p class="c6 it1">
        The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a
        man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder
        and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine
        distemper.
