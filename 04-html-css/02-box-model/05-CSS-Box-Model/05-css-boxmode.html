      <h2>About Cats</h2>
      <p>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral
        cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.

      <h2>Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common
        ancestor about 10–15 million years ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        TThe genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years
        ago.

      <h2>Domestication</h2>
      <p>
        The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F.
        lybica) was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in
        Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since
        there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the
        inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and
        other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to
        early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in
        particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic
        farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats
        lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame
        and domesticated cats.[13][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the
        maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.
